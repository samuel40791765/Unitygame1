Thanks for purchasing this pakage, I hope you are going to have as much fun building your levels, as I had compiling this package.

************

This package is the first in a series of truely mobile assets, low poly models & good quality atlas textures for performance.


Mobile & Desktop:
Even though the name has the word "Mobile" in it, as seen on the webplayer demos,
it really looks good even on desktop.

Also, all the screenshots and DEMOS that you have seen has been achieved with a Diffuse map only,
so no special shaders are required that to make your game look great and save you further system resources.


The scenes that was used for the online DEMOS and the screenshots are included in this package.

Each season has the meshes with season appropriate names for them in the respective folders.
The reason for this is that you could remove say everything except the Winter because your project is only going to require it.

The particle effect are easy to use drag & drop prefabs.

Email me with contents or other asset pack suggestions and they just might find there way into an update for the package, or even full new products.

Send some screenshots to info@3dforge.co.za of your work and I will showcase them on the website


BONUS!!!
Winter comes with a whole extra set of pre-fabs using the bonus texture sheet with light snow of some items.


Enjoy
